Write a simple linked list implementation.

The simplest kind of linked list is a singly linked list.

Each element in the list contains:

- data 
- a "next" field pointing to the next element in the list
of elements.

This variant of linked lists is often used to represent sequences
or push-down stacks (also called a LIFO stack; Last In, First Out).

Let's create a singly linked list whose elements may contain a range of data
such as the numbers 1-10. Provide functions to reverse the linked list and
convert a linked list to and from an array.

input:

- Element constructor is passed two arguments
  - the data it holds
  - an optional argument, a pointer(variable) to the previous element object

output:

-
