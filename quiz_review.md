- Reviewing. `assert_equal` is *better* then `assert` if no optional failure
message is passed to `assert`, so there is more meaningful context for the test.
- `block_given?` is necessary if there's any possibility that a method might not
take a block.
- refute tests only pass if the object passed to it is falsey
